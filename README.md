## Feedback Mechanism
   The feedback mechanism is a core feature of Sentimind AI, allowing users to improve the quality of recommendations over time. Here's how it works:
    
    1. Thumbs Up:
    
        Indicates that the user is satisfied with the recommendations.
    
        The system will:
        
        Prioritize similar products in future searches.
    
        Increase the weight of positive feedback in the CRM for personalized recommendations.
    
    2. Thumbs Down:
    
        Indicates that the user is dissatisfied with the recommendations.
        
        The system will:
        
        Broaden the search criteria or shuffle the results.
        
        Adjust the recommendation algorithm to avoid similar products in the future.
        
        Log the feedback in the CRM for future reference.
    
    3. Feedback Integration:
    
        All feedback is stored in the CRM under the user's profile.
        
        The system uses this feedback to refine its understanding of user preferences and improve future interactions.
